# Arithmetic-formatter-freecodecamp
First project for Python on freecodecamp certification.
Description : 
Students in primary school often arrange arithmetic problems vertically to make them easier to solve. For example, "235 + 52" becomes:
<p>&nbsp; 235 </p>
+  52
<p>&nbsp; -----</p>
Create a function that receives a list of strings that are arithmetic problems and returns the problems arranged vertically and side-by-side.
